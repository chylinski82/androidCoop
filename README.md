# Android Coop

Android Coop is my very own remake of the all times classic "the Chicken Coop", a little game console made in Soviet Union(!!). Perfect for smartphones, though has responsive design.

"Android Coop" has 12 difficulty/speed levels, and gets very tricky for level 10 on.

## Installation

To play the game, simply go to [http://android-coop.surge.sh](http://android-coop.surge.sh) and click/tap to play.

## Usage

The goal of the game is to catch as many eggs as possible without letting them drop to the ground. Simply tap the chicken that is dropping an egg to catch it. For keyboard users, use keys Q and A for the chickens on the left and P and L for the chickens on the right.

## Known Issues

The game is functioning fine, though the music doesn't work on some devices.

## Contribute

This game is developed with PhaserJS, and contributions in any form are welcome, especially a fix for the music issue. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:k.chylinski82@gmail.com) for more information.
